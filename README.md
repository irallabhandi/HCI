# Web application for hospital emergency rooms (ER)
This repository contains all the necessary elements of a UX Case Study to design a web application that:
- Shows the user a list of nearby hospitals
- Gives the user basic first aid assistance
- Lets the user fill out electronic ER registration and consent forms for themselves before hand
- Lets the user fill out electronic ER registration and consent forms for strangers/friends/family
- It gives the user multiple language options to fill the forms and also has a speech to text feature for those who cannot read and write.
